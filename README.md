Hi, my name is Lyssa and I'm a Junior Full-stack Software engineer.

My love of how things work is what lead me towards a career in tech.

I have studied a few game creation courses on Udemy, which is where I discovered that I really enjoy coding and the problem solving that comes with it.

When I found out about the _Nology 12 week bootcamp I jumped at the chance to kickstart my career!
